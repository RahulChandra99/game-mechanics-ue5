# AAA-Game-Mechanics

This collection of Unreal Engine projects was developed to experiment with AAA game mechanics using C++. Each project explores different gameplay systems found in modern AAA games, such as RPGs, first-person shooters, action-adventure games, and more. The primary objective is to implement complex game mechanics.

All projects were developed using Unreal Engine with a mix of Blueprints and C++. Some projects incorporate AI, advanced combat mechanics, procedural systems, and multiplayer functionalities. Each project is aimed at replicating or building upon mechanics found in popular AAA games.

## Mechanic 1: Combat System like RPG Games
A combat system inspired by RPG games, where players can perform light and heavy attacks, combos, and special abilities. The system includes health, stamina, and ability cooldowns, along with enemy AI that responds to player actions.

## Mechanic 2: Spell-break
An ability-based combat system inspired by games like *Spellbreak*. Players can cast a variety of elemental spells with different effects, such as fireballs, ice spikes, and electric blasts. This project focuses on integrating magic systems with physics interactions.

## Mechanic 3: Mini-map, Compass, and Marking System
A navigation system featuring a mini-map, compass, and marking system that allows players to tag enemies, items, or locations. This mechanic provides important HUD elements that assist in player orientation and strategy.

## Mechanic 4: Half Life / FPS Mechanics
A first-person shooter mechanic inspired by *Half-Life*. The system includes gunplay, ammo management, health, and interaction with physics-based objects in the environment. It focuses on smooth player control and immersive shooting mechanics.

## Mechanic 5: Specter Divide Teleportation
A teleportation mechanic similar to that seen in *Dishonored* or *Prey*, where players can aim and teleport to different locations. This system allows for strategic movement and quick traversal of levels, adding a layer of stealth gameplay.

## Mechanic 6: Batman / Superhero Theme Like Mechanics
An action-adventure mechanic inspired by superhero games like *Batman: Arkham Asylum*. Players can glide, grapple, and perform cinematic takedowns, all while using stealth and gadgets to outmaneuver enemies.

## Mechanic 7: Horror Game Mechanics
A collection of horror game systems including jump scares, dynamic lighting, enemy AI that hunts the player, and environmental puzzles. The focus is on creating tension and fear through atmosphere and unpredictable enemy behaviors.

## Mechanic 8: AI Game Mechanics
A framework for AI behavior in games, including patrol routes, enemy vision cones, and reaction systems. The AI responds to player inputs and changes its state based on proximity, noise, or visual cues.

## Mechanic 9: UE Multiplayer Plugin
A multiplayer system integrated into Unreal Engine, allowing for cooperative or competitive play. This plugin supports player matchmaking, lobbies, and in-game synchronization, enabling both peer-to-peer and server-based multiplayer experiences.

## Mechanic 10: Procedural Dungeon Series (Unity + Unreal)
A hybrid project using both Unity and Unreal to create procedural dungeons. This system generates random levels, complete with enemies, loot, and traps, offering high replayability for dungeon crawler games.

## Mechanic 11: Tekken Like Fighting
A fighting game mechanic inspired by *Tekken*, where players can perform combos, counters, and special moves in a 3D arena. The system includes a dynamic camera, hit detection, and player health tracking.

## Mechanic 12: Turn-Based Hitman Go
A turn-based strategy mechanic inspired by *Hitman Go*. Players move across a grid to complete objectives while avoiding enemy detection. The game includes puzzles that require careful planning and use of tools.

## Mechanic 13: Hitman Sniper (with UI) + UE User Interface
A sniper-focused game mechanic where players take down targets from a distance. This project integrates a detailed user interface for mission objectives, zoom controls, and weapon customization.

## Mechanic 14: Shooter Game Mechanics (Battle Royale)
A battle royale system featuring drop-in gameplay, loot collection, shrinking play areas, and combat against other players. The focus is on creating a last-man-standing scenario with a variety of weapons and equipment.

## Mechanic 15: Quick Mechanics
A collection of smaller mechanics, including quick-time events, contextual actions, and minor gameplay elements that can be easily integrated into larger systems. These mechanics are designed for rapid implementation and testing in various game types.
